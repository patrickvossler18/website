I am a statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California. My advisors are Prof. [Yingying Fan](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Yingying-Fan/) and Prof. [Jinchi Lv](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jinchi-lv). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Economics from USC in 2017.


My research focuses on developing new statistical methodologies for high-dimensional data and expanding our theoretical understanding of commonly-used machine learning methods in high-dimensional settings. I am particularly interested in developing non-parametric methods with rigorous statistical guarantees for causal inference problems.
